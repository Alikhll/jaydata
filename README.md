JayData
=======
JayData is a standards-based (mostly HTML5), cross-platform JavaScript library and a set of practices to access 
and manipulate data from various online and offline sources

JayData not only provides JavaScript Language Query (JSLQ) syntax to access local (in-browser and mobile) 
and remote databases, but builds the queries and executes/processes the requests of the essential data 
sources and data services to make developers able to concentrate only on the business logic. 

Microsoft .NET developers can utilize Entity Framework and LINQ on server-side to perform operations on 
data from different databases. The aim of JayData library is to give a similar tool to JavaScript developers.

JayData is cross-platform (runs on HTML5 desktop and mobile browsers, can be hosted in PhoneGap environment 
on iPhone, iPad and Android) and cross-layer as it works on client-side and server-side (Node.JS).
